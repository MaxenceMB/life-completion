						+ "We got a wheel turning to pick up random bad ingredients for our pizzas and i got Frangipane. Bro. "
						+ "It was an amazing night. But the real awesome night was saturday, the real day. "
						+ "I went to my mom's house for dinner and I knew Tatie MÃ©linda and Tonton Olivier would be invited and I was so happy about it. "

						+ "The week is sadly getting a lower grade because of the weather, the classes and more importantly: the horrible week coming just after. "
						+ "In fact, I am writing this during this famous 'next week' and the amount of work we need to do is insane. "
